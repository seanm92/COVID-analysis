# COVID-analysis
Countries clustering on COVID deterioration rate

In this project I used open data set from kaggle, which included the number of deaths in each country in each day. After normalizing it by the population size
I used DTW to find the distance between the rates of each country, and than via hierarchical clustering I found groups among the contries.
There were some intresting findings, such as, that Spain and Italy each got their own seperate cluster, wheres Belgium and France were in the same cluster, 
Israel was in the same cluster with Chila and Finland.
